# ONLY FRONTEND VUE - APP
[ PREVIEW ==> https://643fea4209281911da0c987f--dynamic-vacherin-cad846.netlify.app ]

I'm studying Vue and decided to push a repository only for the frontend project by now.
It's obviously useless without a server and a database but this is enough to be deployed without having a server constantly listening.

I hope you'll like it!


`npm install`
`npm run dev`
